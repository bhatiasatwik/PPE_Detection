# Object Detection : PPE kit detection at construction sites using YOLO model trained on custom dataset
### this was my minor project for third semester for my bachelor's in technology (B.Tech).
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or a video. 
The goal is to not only classify the objects present but also to determine their precise positions in the visual data. 
This technology has widespread applications, ranging from autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems to augmented reality and image retrieval.
